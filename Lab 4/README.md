# Programming Paradigms

This project aims to explore different programming techniques, such as Divide & Conquer, Dynamic Programming and Greedy algorithms. It does so through two well-known CS problems, the Coin Change problem and the Subset Sum Problem, which allow for several comparisons between the programming techniques
